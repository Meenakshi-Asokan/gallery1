gallery for fun stuff - testing

To remember when adding more sections and more images

1) add the photos and the thumbnails in the respective folders
2) might have to run this - https://github.com/haltakov/simple-photo-gallery if you want the data height and width from the html file
3) for each new section data-index will start from 0 as the default case but data-gallery for each new section will have to be changed to the total number of all the images in all the previous sections.
